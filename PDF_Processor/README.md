# PDF_Processor

pdf_processor.py
 - A file that will read a PDF file and mine for specific data like dates, numbers, and other required or needed data fields
   - Uses PDF2TXT.py (built-in python library) to convert the PDF to text
   - As well as using an OCR Library that will covert a PDF to image and then to text
   - And also use a method that will convert a PDF to HTML 

I do not own *PDF2TXT.py*
